View changes made by users within WordPress. See who created a page, uploaded an attachment or approved an comment, and more.

== Description ==

Simple History shows recent changes made within WordPress, directly on your dashboard or on a separate page.

The plugin works as a log/history/audit log/version history of the most important events that occur in WordPress.

Out of the box Simple History has support for:

* **Posts and pages**<br>
see who added, updated or deleted a post or page
* **Attachments**<br>
see who added, updated or deleted an attachment
* **Comments**<br>
see who edited, approved or removed a comment
* **Widgets**<br>
get info when someone adds, updates or removes a widget in a sidebar
* **Plugins**<br>
activation and deactivation
* **User profiles**<br>
info about added, updated or removed users
* **User logins**<br>
see when a user login & logut
* **Failed user logins**<br>
see when someone has tried to log in, but failed. The log will then include ip address of the possible hacker.

There is also a **RSS feed of changes** available, so you can keep track of the changes made via your favorite RSS reader on your phone, on your iPad, or on your computer.

It’s a plugin that is good to have on websites where several people are
involved in editing the content.

#### Example scenarios

Keep track of what other people are doing:
_"Has someone done anything today? Ah, Sarah uploaded
the new press release and created an article for it. Great! Now I don't have to do that."_

Or for debug purposes:
_"The site feels very slow since yesterday. Has anyone done anything special? ... Ah, Steven activated 'naughy-plugin-x',
that must be it."_

#### See it in action

#### API so you can add your own events to Simple History

If you are a theme or plugin developer and would like to add your own things/events to Simple History you can do that by calling the function `simple_history_add()` like this:

`
<?php

if ( function_exists("SimpleLogger") ) {

    // Most basic example: just add some information to the log
    SimpleLogger()->info("This is a message sent to the log");

    // A bit more advanced: log events with different severities
    SimpleLogger()->info("User admin edited page 'About our company'");
    SimpleLogger()->warning("User 'Jessie' deleted user 'Kim'");
    SimpleLogger()->debug("Ok, cron job is running!");

}
?>
`

== Screenshots ==

1. The log view + it also shows the filter function in use - the log only shows event that
are of type post and pages and media (i.e. images & other uploads), and only events
initiated by a specific user.

2. Events with different severity – Simple History uses the log levels specified in the PHP PSR-3 standard.

3. Events have context with extra details - Each logged event can include useful rich formatted extra information. For example: a plugin install can contain author info and a the url to the plugin, and an uploaded image can contain a thumbnail of the image.


== Changelog ==

= 2.0.6 (November 2014) =

- Added: [WordPress 4.1 added the feature to log out a user from all their sessions](http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.1#Users). Simple History now logs when a user is logged out from all their sessions except the current browser, or if an admin destroys all sessions for a user. [View screenshot of new session logout log item](http://glui.me/?d=k4cmfmncekmfiib/2014-12-simple-history-changelog-user-sessions.png/)

- Added POT-file

= 0.3.5 =
- using get_the_title instead of fetching the title directly from the post object. should make plugins like qtranslate work a bit better.

- the name of deleted items now show up, instead of "Unknown name" or similar
- added support for plugins (who activated/deactivated what plugin)
- support for third party history items. Use like this:
simple_history_add("action=repaired&object_type=starship&object_name=USS Enterprise");
this would result in somehting like this:
Starship "USS Enterprise" repaired
by admin (John Doe), just now
- capability edit_pages needed to show history. Is this an appropriate capability do you think?
